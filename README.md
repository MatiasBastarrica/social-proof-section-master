- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned that I can combine grid and flexbox with margins to achieve different kind of layouts.

### Continued development

In the future I'd like to keep working with nested layouts, that is flexbox inside a grid layout and viceversa.
